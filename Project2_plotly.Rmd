#Summary
This document shows the increase weights of chickens when feeding different diets across time. There are 50 chickens and 4 diets. Those 50 chickens are seperated into 4 groups, and each group was fed with one diet.

```{r}
data(ChickWeight)
library(plotly)
g <- ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, colour = Diet, group = Chick))
g <- g + geom_line()
g <- g + facet_grid(. ~ Diet)
ggplotly(g)
```
